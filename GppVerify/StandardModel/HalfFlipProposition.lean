## What is formalized here

Lemma 2.1 (antiunitary conjugation is unitary composed with transpose, on
Hermitian inputs): for A = U∘K antiunitary (U unitary, K entrywise complex
conjugation) and ρ a Hermitian density operator, A ρ A⁻¹ = U ρ̄ Uᴴ, where ρ̄
is the entrywise conjugate of ρ; since ρ is Hermitian, ρ̄ = ρᵀ, so this
equals U ρᵀ Uᴴ. The whole content reduces to the one fact that a Hermitian
matrix's entrywise conjugate is its transpose, proved below
(`hermitian_map_star_eq_transpose`), from which the displayed identity
(`antiunitary_conj_eq_unitary_transpose`) follows immediately.

A new operational theorem separates two statements that are often conflated.
The transpose/antiunitary action cannot be enacted on an unknown qubit state by
itself as a completely positive quantum channel.  But if both the state and the
measurement frame are transposed, every Born trace pairing is unchanged.  Thus
there is no contradiction between the no-enactment theorem and the statement
that a globally conjugated description of the entire experiment is operationally
indistinguishable.

Proposition 4.1(a) (Wigner time reversal is the universal spin inverter):
on ℂ², T(ψ₁,ψ₂) = (conj ψ₂, -conj ψ₁) is exactly i·σy·K. Proved: ⟨ψ,Tψ⟩ = 0
identically (`wignerT_orthogonal`), and T² = -1 (`wignerT_wignerT`).

Proposition 2.2 (No-Enactment), for `d = 2`, is imported from the actual
Choi-matrix / complete-positivity development and exposed below as a substantive
theorem rather than the former `True` placeholder.

Proposition 4.1(c) is now formalized algebraically without a Bloch-sphere parametrization.
The exact Pauli identity
`Σᵢ σᵢ A σᵢ = 2 Tr(A) I - A` gives the equal-Pauli channel
`E(ρ) = (2I-ρ)/3` for every trace-one qubit state.  If `ρ²=ρ`, then the overlap
with the orthogonal projector `I-ρ` is exactly `2/3`.
