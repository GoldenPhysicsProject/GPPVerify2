# Weyl Vector Casimir for U(4) ≅ A₃ ⊕ U(1)

Source: zitterbewegung_T_boundary_FINAL.tex, Theorem thm:weyl-casimir-value
The Weyl vector ρ_G for U(4) has ⟨ρ_G, ρ_G⟩ = 5.

The roots of A₃ = SU(4) are: ±e_i ± e_j (1≤i<j≤4).
The Weyl vector ρ = (3,1,-1,-3)/2 in the standard basis.
⟨ρ,ρ⟩ = (9+1+1+9)/4 = 20/4 = 5.

The main result is now the actual vector/dot-product computation
`rhoA3_dot_self`, not just arithmetic on the numerator; the bare
numerator identities below are recorded as corollaries.

Chronology correction (2026-09-02): older T-boundary manuscripts also attached
Majorana-neutrino, massless-lightest-neutrino, and mirror-baryon conclusions to
this algebraic neighborhood. Those physical conclusions depended on the now
superseded claim that ordinary Wigner time reversal flips helicity. They are not
consequences of the Weyl/Casimir calculations and have therefore been removed
from this file. The exact Lie-theoretic identities remain.

/-! ## Spin(8) triality Casimir: C₂ = 7 for all three 8-dimensional reps

Source: holographic_chain_v932.tex, Definition "Triality" (Def 6.2). The
Weyl vector of D₄ = Spin(8) is ρ = (3,2,1,0); the vector, spinor, and
cospinor weights are λᵥ=(1,0,0,0), λₛ=(½,½,½,½), λ_c=(½,½,½,-½). The
Casimir formula C₂(λ) = ⟨λ,λ+2ρ⟩ gives the same value 7 for all three.
This is an exact algebraic shadow of Spin(8) triality. Equality of these
quadratic Casimirs does not by itself identify bosonic and fermionic sectors,
nor does it imply equality of conformal weights without an additional model-
specific relation between C₂ and the conformal Hamiltonian.
