# Normalized celestial spectral-weight moment family

This module repackages the already-proved Stefan–Boltzmann/Mellin family at the
normalization used by the bilateral celestial/chamber probability density

  rho(lam) = (2/pi) * P(lam),   P(lam) = pi*lam/sinh(pi*lam).

For exponents for which the integrand is even (in particular the integer sequence
`s = 2n+1`), the factor `4/pi` multiplying the positive half-line integral is exactly
the full-line rho moment.  The theorem below is stated for every real `s > 0` as a
half-line identity, so no parity assumption is hidden in the formal statement.
