# The spectral weight `P(λ) = πλ/sinh(πλ)`: Planck form and the reciprocal product

From Toupin, "The Spectral Weight π λ / sinh π λ" and "Modular Thermality of the Celestial
Spectral Weight" (2026): `P(λ)` is the two-particle massless phase-space weight of a
celestial unitarity cut, `Γ(1+iλ)Γ(1-iλ)` on the shadow locus (`GammaModulusIdentity.lean`).
This file records two further identities it satisfies.

* `planck_form`: `P` written as a difference of two Bose occupation numbers at spacings
  `πλ` and `2πλ`, a genuine Planck-form identity with the zero-point energies of the two
  terms cancelling exactly.
* `one_div_P_tendsto_tprod`: the reciprocal `1/P(λ)` is the Weierstrass product
  `∏ₙ(1+λ²/n²)` as a `Tendsto` statement, an immediate restatement of
  `GppSinhWeierstrass.tendsto_prod_one_add_sq_div` for `λ ≠ 0`.
* `principal_series_normalized_mean` / `principal_series_normalized_variance`: the exact
  algebraic normalization consequence of the analytically established principal-series
  digamma moments `A₀ = 1/4`, `A₁ = A₂ = 1/8`.  These theorems deliberately take the
  three moment evaluations as hypotheses; they do not claim to formalize the integral
  evaluations themselves.

    numbers at spacings `πλ` and `2πλ`. The zero-point energies of the two Bose terms
    (`πλ/2` and `2πλ/2`) cancel identically, which is why no additive constant survives. -/
