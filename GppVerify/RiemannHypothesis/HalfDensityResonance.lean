# Critical half-density resonance algebra

At the critical half-density weight, the smooth Möbius correction indexed by `n`
has continuum exponent `1/n - 3/2`, while the prime-repetition channel indexed by
`m` has exponent `-m/2`.  This file formalizes the exact algebraic resonance
condition between those two scaling degrees.

This is only a scaling identity.  It does not assert convergence, positivity, an
explicit-formula theorem, or RH.
