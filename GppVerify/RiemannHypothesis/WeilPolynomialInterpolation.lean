# Polynomial multiplier interpolation on finite Weil pair-supports

The preceding interpolation bridge isolates the exact finite-surjectivity target:
arbitrary values only on `S ∪ iota(S)` are needed.  Over `ℂ`, that finite
interpolation problem is algebraically automatic by Lagrange interpolation.

More importantly for an actual Mellin/Paley--Wiener test class, suppose the class
contains one transform `h` which is nonzero on the relevant finite support and is
closed under multiplication by polynomial functions of the spectral variable.
Then arbitrary data on that support can be interpolated by multiplying `h` by a
Lagrange polynomial.  Thus the remaining analytic burden is reduced from an
abstract surjectivity theorem to two concrete properties:

1. a nonvanishing seed transform on the required zero support;
2. closure of the admissible transform class under polynomial spectral multipliers.

This file proves only that algebraic reduction.  It does not assert that a specific
Weil/Mellin test class satisfies those two analytic properties, and makes no RH
claim by itself.

/-- **Seed-plus-polynomial-closure reduction to RH.**  Suppose admissible test
transforms are positive for every finite Weil paired form.  If, for every finite
zero support, the class contains one transform nonvanishing on the corresponding
pair-support and is closed under polynomial spectral multipliers of that seed,
then the finite interpolation hypothesis of `WeilInterpolationBridge` follows,
and hence so does the already-formalized Weil criterion conclusion.

The hypotheses are deliberately explicit: this theorem is a reduction, not a
proof that the analytic Mellin/Paley--Wiener class has these properties. -/
