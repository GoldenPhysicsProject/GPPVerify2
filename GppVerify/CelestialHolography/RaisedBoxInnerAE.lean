# Almost-everywhere inner-slice regulator limit for the raised box

The scalar-box proof is organized as nested interval dominated convergence.
At the innermost stage, for fixed strict-interior `x₁,x₂`, the only point of
`Ioc 0 (1-x₁-x₂)` where strict simplex interior can fail is the upper endpoint.
Lebesgue measure is nonatomic, so that single endpoint may be discarded almost
everywhere.  This file packages exactly the AE pointwise-convergence hypothesis
needed by the first interval-DCT step.

/-- For fixed `x₁,x₂` in the strict two-dimensional base of the simplex, the
raised-box integrand tends to one for almost every point of the inner interval.
The sole exceptional point in `Ioc 0 (1-x₁-x₂)` is its upper endpoint. -/
