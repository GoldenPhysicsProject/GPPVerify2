# Completed arithmetic defect criterion

The finite prime-local AFT sector now has an explicit positive factor map, but the
completed explicit formula carries the prime contribution with the opposite sign.
This file isolates the exact non-circular theorem that would make such a signed
completion positive.

For an arithmetic test state `x`, let `Ainf x` denote an Archimedean/ambient
amplitude and `Aprime x` the assembled prime amplitude. If the prime channel is
contractively dominated,

  ||Aprime x|| <= ||Ainf x||,

then the signed completed quadratic quantity

  ||Ainf x||^2 - ||Aprime x||^2

is nonnegative. If, more strongly, this defect is the norm square of a physical
quotient amplitude, positivity is an exact no-ghost identity.

This file proves the abstract and factorized criteria. It does not yet construct
the actual arithmetic transfer operator, identify the resulting defect with the
full Weil form, or prove RH.

the ambient amplitude by a norm-contractive transfer map `C`, then the signed

`C`, prove `Aprime = C ∘ Ainf`, and prove `C` contractive. -/
