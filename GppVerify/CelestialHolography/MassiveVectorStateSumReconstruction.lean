# Massive-vector / scalar state-count reconstruction

This file isolates only the exact state-count algebra justified by the symbolic
adjacent-MHV audit and dimensional-reconstruction bookkeeping. It does not identify
couplings, color factors, cut orientation, or loop-measure normalizations with any
particular amplitude convention, and it does not compute the still-missing
`D_s = 4`, `mu != 0` gluon sewing numerator.

/-! ## Spin-dimension reconstruction at fixed loop momentum

Changing the spin-state dimension `D_s` while holding the D-dimensional loop
momentum fixed adds one real adjoint-scalar polarization per additional spin
direction beyond four. The formulas below encode only that linear state-counting
law. In particular `D_s = 4` does **not** set the dimensional mass `mu` to zero.

/-- Linear dimensional-reconstruction model at fixed loop momentum:
`C^(D_s) = C^(4) + (D_s - 4) C_scalar`, where `C_scalar` denotes one real
adjoint-scalar species. -/
