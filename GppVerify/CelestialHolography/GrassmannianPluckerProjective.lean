# Projective covariance of Plücker coordinates

The existing holographic-chain file proves the Plücker relation for a chosen ordered
pair `(v1,v2)` in `ℂ^4`.  To descend from a frame to the Grassmannian point represented
by that frame, one needs the basis-change law: under a `2 × 2` change of frame, all six
Plücker coordinates acquire the same determinant factor.  Therefore their projective
class is frame-independent whenever the change of frame is invertible.

The antiunitary googly exchange is conjugate-linear on this common scale.  Hence it
respects projective equivalence and defines an involution on projective Plücker classes;
combined with preservation of the Plücker quadric, this is the algebraic projective
shadow on the Klein quadric.
