# Antiunitary googly exchange on ∧²ℂ⁴

The Hodge-star decomposition in `HolographicChain` already gives explicit self-dual
and anti-self-dual sectors.  Complex conjugation alone preserves those sectors because
the chosen Hodge-star matrix is real.  The helicity/googly exchange therefore also
requires orientation reversal.  The map below combines complex conjugation with an
orientation sign flip and hence anti-commutes with the Hodge star.

This is the finite-dimensional algebraic core needed before identifying the same
operation with celestial shadow/time reversal.  No claim about the full nonlinear
Penrose-Ward correspondence is made here.
