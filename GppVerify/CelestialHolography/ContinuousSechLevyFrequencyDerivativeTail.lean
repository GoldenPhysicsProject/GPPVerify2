# Exponential tail infrastructure for the continuous sech Lévy derivative

The global derivative bound controls the origin but is not integrable at infinity.
This file isolates the exact hyperbolic-sine lower bound and the resulting exponential
decay on `|x| >= 1`.  It is deliberately kept separate from differentiation under the
integral.
