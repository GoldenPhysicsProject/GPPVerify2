# Raised-box outer fiber bridge

This file starts the final bridge from the measurable full-simplex product
fiber used for outer-coordinate measurability to the nested interval integral
used in the concrete raised-box moment.

The first exact step is set-theoretic: on the physical outer interval, the
section of the full three-simplex at fixed `x1` factors into the middle interval
`0 ≤ x2 ≤ 1-x1` and the already-certified two-dimensional inner simplex strip.
No Fubini or integrability hypothesis is needed for this factorization.

/-- On the physical outer interval, membership in the full grouped simplex
section is equivalent to membership of `x2` in its affine interval together
with membership of `(x2,x3)` in the inner simplex strip. -/
