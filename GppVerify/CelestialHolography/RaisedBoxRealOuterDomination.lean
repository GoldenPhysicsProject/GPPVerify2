# Raised-box real majorant: outer-kernel domination

After the exact `x3` and `x2` integrations, the singular part of the raised-box
majorant is proportional to

  x^(-δ) (1-x)^(2-δ)

on `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`.  For the physical range `δ < 1`, the second factor is at most
one.  Hence the outer kernel is dominated by the already-certified integrable
endpoint singularity `x^(-δ)`.  This avoids duplicating the complex Beta
calculation on the real side: exact Beta/Gamma evaluation and real DCT
integrability are kept as separate layers.
